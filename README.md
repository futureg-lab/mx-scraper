# mx-scraper

Download image galleries or metadata on the web.

> This rewrite is expected to support previous implementation's metadata format.
>
> The main idea was to separate the core (mx-scraper) from the plugins (user
> defined) as it was not possible from previous implementations.

# Usage

```bash
# the `images` plugin uses bs4
# This will for example download all image links using the `images` plugin.
pip install beautifulsoup4
mx-scraper fetch https://www.google.com --plugin images -v

# Alternatively, for a sequence of non-uniform terms, prefixing is often required
# It is unnecessary but it not required for generic ones (like ids or names)
# The behavior of how each term is parsed depends on the plugin implementation
mx-scraper fetch --meta-only -v img:https://www.google.com to:https://mto.to/series/68737
